Hi guys, I want to film my swim stoke to analyze my technique. However I swim at a pool where I very rarely have a lane to myself and I am wondering if I would even be allowed to bring a GoPro or my phone in to the pool. I guess I should just ask the lifeguard next time I am at the pool but I am just wondering how people manage to film themselves during swim sessions? Thanks. Any one care to share any moments where they felt kinda dumb in the pool to make me lighten up a little. Im sure this is "lost media" But im not sure that theres a market or desire for it. Copyright looks to be 1979 shows real interactions with lifeguards and drowning victims and narrates what the life guards did right in the situation Ive never really found anything like this, is it worth it to upload? Ive all the equipment already so the only resource wasted is time lol What do yall think. 
I know its kinda pathetic, but recently I went to the beach and while sunbathing some kids decided to dunk water on me. Of course I was mad so I got up and asked where are their parents, for which they laughed "they are dead". Now what am I supposed to do in such a situation? I can tell them off but at the same time I don't want to overstep social boundaries. I ended up watching it one night late at night. I assume it was the 70's by the quality and style of the film, it's was definitely British. From what I remember it was a story of sexual awakening with the boy falling for the foreign (I think she was foreign) lifeguard.

This is my first time posting to a revenge subreddit so please feel free to criticise to help me improve. Anyway onto the story. This was years ago so events may have been subconsciously embellished.

I've lived in Westchester all my life (Greenburgh specifically) and I'm just doing an open-call looking to broaden my friendship horizons, it's been a bit of a struggle finding new people to hang out with I didn't go to college with, etc. But I'd really like a drinking buddy or someone to just goof off with whenever.

Hey all! I backed the Kickstarter to fund the making of the "Part Of Water" Documentary about Newport Beach Lifeguard Ben Carlson. amp#x200B; gtLittle Bit about the films subject - gt gtA 15-year veteran of the Newport Beach Lifeguards, Carlson epitomized the spirit of a lifeguard and the Newport Beach community as a whole. He is the only U.S. lifeguard to lose his life in the line of duty. gt gtFilmmakers Tim Burnham and Jack Murgatroyd are undertaking a project about. 10 year old Angelo Puglisi, known to his family and friends as Andy, was last seen in Lawrence, Massachusetts, on August 21, 1976. While Lawrence was one of the poorest cities in the United States, Lawrence contributed something nice for the people in the community to enjoy; Higgins Memorial Pool. Just 100 yards away from the housing projects, Andy and other children could swim for just 25¢. According to the Lawrence Police Department, there were five known pedophiles I went down to r/analog yesterday with Portra 400, the son of Kodak, to upload a picture of the Godess; and, at the same time, I wanted to observe how they would put on the festival, since they were now holding it for the first time. Now, in my opinion, the procession of the native inhabitants were fine; but the one the Film Photographers conducted no less a fitting show. After we had prayed and looked on, we went off toward upvotes. \-Socrates in the opening words of Plato's The Republic. I've lived in Westchester all my life (Greenburgh specifically) and I'm really getting tired of really struggling to meet people. Every girl I've tried to get with ended up blowing up in my face or just not panning out. I've tried and tried but never found anyone truly special who has brought that same feeling back.
